Mr. Schnapper. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS"
2,"MR. SCHNAPPER","mister chief justice and may it please the court section c distinguishes between claims that seek to hold an internet company liable for content created by someone else and claims based on the companys own conduct that distinction is drawn in each of the three sections of the statute first section c is limited to claims that would treat the defendant as a publisher of thirdparty content the statute uses publish in the common law sense the fourth circuit decision in henderson correctly interprets the statute in that manner and concludes that it involves two elements the claim must be based on the action of the defendant in disseminating thirdparty content and the harm must arise from the content itself second section   c is limited to publication of information provided by another content provider which is often referred to as thirdparty content the statutory defense does not apply insofar as a claim is based on words written by the defendant or other content created by the defendant in some circumstances the manner in which thirdparty content is organized or presented could convey other information from the defendant itself as the government notes third section c only applies insofar as a defendant was acting as an internet computer service most entities that are internet computer services do other things as well this court technically is an interactive computer service because of its website it does other things as it is doing today conduct that falls outside that line of activity is outside the scope of this statute a number of the briefs in this case urge the court to adopt a general rule that things that might be referred to as a recommendation are inherently protected by the statute a decision which would require the court to then fashion some judicial definition of recommendation we think the court should decline that invitation and should instead focus on interpreting the specific language of the statute i welcome the courts quest"," Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 230(c)(1) distinguishes between claims that seek to hold an Internet company liable for content created by someone else and claims based on the company's own conduct. That distinction is drawn in each of the three sections of the statute. First, Section 230(c)(1) is limited to claims that would treat the defendant as a publisher of third-party content. The statute uses ""publish"" in the common law sense. The Fourth Circuit decision in Henderson correctly interprets the statute in that manner and concludes that it involves two elements: the claim must be based on the action of the defendant in disseminating third-party content, and the harm must arise from the content itself. Second, Section 231 -- 230(c)(1) is limited to publication of information provided by another content provider, which is often referred to as third-party content. The statutory defense doesn't apply insofar as a claim is based on words written by the defendant or other content created by the defendant. In some circumstances, the manner in which third-party content is organized or presented could convey other information from the defendant itself, as the government notes. Third, Section 230(c)(1) only applies insofar as a defendant was acting as an Internet computer service. Most entities that are Internet computer services do other things as well. This Court technically is an interactive computer service because of its website. It does other things, as it is doing today. Conduct that falls outside that line of activity is outside the scope of this statute. A number of the briefs in this case urge the Court to adopt a general rule that things that might be referred to as a recommendation are inherently protected by the statute, a decision which would require the Court to then fashion some judicial definition of ""recommendation."" We think the Court should decline that invitation and should instead focus on interpreting the specific language of the statute. I welcome the Court's questions."
3,"JUSTICE THOMAS","mister snapper  schnapper just so we are clear about what we are  your claim is are you saying that youtubes application of its algorithm is particular to  in this case that they are using a different algorithm to the one that say they are using for cooking videos or are they using the same algorithm across the board"," Mr. Snapper -- Schnapper, just so we're clear about what we're -- your claim is, are you saying that YouTube's application of its algorithm is particular to -- in this case, that they're using a different algorithm to the one that, say, they're using for cooking videos, or are they using the same algorithm across the board?"

6,"MR. SCHNAPPER"," the board"," -- the board."
7,"JUSTICE THOMAS"," so what is  if  if it is the same algorithm i think you have to give us a clearer example of what your point is exactly the same algorithm to present cooking videos to people who are interested in cooking and isis videos to people who are interested in isis racing videos to people who are interested in racing then i think you are going to have to explain more clearly if it is neutral in that way how your claim is set apart from that"," -- so what is -- if -- if it's the same algorithm, I think you have to give us a clearer example of what your point is exactly. The same algorithm to present cooking videos to people who are interested in cooking and ISIS videos to people who are interested in ISIS, racing videos to people who are interested in racing. Then I think you're going to have to explain more clearly, if it's neutral in that way, how your claim is set apart from that."
8,"MR. SCHNAPPER","surely the  if i might turn to the practice of displaying thumbnails which is a major part of what is at issue here the problem  and the issue is not the manner in which youtube displays videos it actually displays as you doubtless know from having looked at these little pictures which are referred to as thumbnails they are intended to encourage the viewer to click on them and go see a video it is the use of algorithms to generate these  these thumbnails that is at issue and the thumbnails in turn involve a  involve content created by the defend"," Surely. The -- if I might turn to the practice of displaying thumbnails, which is a major part of what's at issue here, the problem -- and the issue is not the manner in which YouTube displays videos. It actually displays, as you doubtless know from having looked at, these little pictures, which are referred to as thumbnails. They are intended to encourage the viewer to click on them and go see a video. It's the use of algorithms to generate these -- these thumbnails that's at issue, and the thumbnails, in turn, involve a -- involve content created by the defendant."
9,"JUSTICE THOMAS","but the  it is basing  the thumbnails from what i understand is based upon what the algorithm suggests the user is interested in so if you are interested in cooking you do not want thumbnails on light jazz you  so the  it is  it is  it is neutral in that sense you are interested in cooking say you get interested in rice  in pilaf from uzbekistan you do not want pilaf from some other place say louisiana the  so the  i do not see how that is any different from what is happening in this case and what i am trying to get you to focus on is if  if the  are we talking about the neutral application of an algorithm that works generically for pilaf and  and it also works in a similar way for isis videos or is there something differ"," But the -- it's basing -- the thumbnails, from what I understand, is based upon what the algorithm suggests the user is interested in. So, if you're interested in cooking, you don't want thumbnails on light jazz. You -- so the -- it's -- it's -- it's neutral in that sense. You're interested in cooking. Say you get interested in rice -- in pilaf from Uzbekistan. You don't want pilaf from some other place, say, Louisiana. The -- so the -- I don't see how that is any different from what is happening in this case. And what I'm trying to get you to focus on is if -- if the -- are we talking about the neutral application of an algorithm that works generically for pilaf and -- and it also works in a similar way for ISIS videos? Or is there something different?"
10,"MR. SCHNAPPER","no i think that is correct but  but our  our view is that the fact that a  a  an algorithm is neutral does not alter the application of the statute the statute requires that one work through each of the elements of the defense and see if it applies the  the lower courts in a couple of cases have said that  really disregarding the requirements of the  of the defense that as long as an algorithm is neutral that puts the  the conduct outside the  within the protection of the statute but that is not what the statute says the statute says you must be acting  you must be  the claim must treat you as a publish"," No, I think that's correct, but -- but our -- our view is that the fact that a -- a -- an algorithm is neutral doesn't alter the application of the statute. The statute requires that one work through each of the elements of the defense and see if it applies. The -- the lower courts, in a couple of cases, have said that -- really disregarding the requirements of the -- of the defense, that as long as an algorithm is neutral, that puts the -- the conduct outside the -- within the protection of the statute. But that's not what the statute says. The statute says you must be acting -- you must be -- the claim must treat you as a publisher. "
11,"JUSTICE ROBERTS","well but i mean the  the  the difference is that the google you  youtube they are still not responsible for the content of the videos or  or text that is transmitted your focus is on the actual selection and recommendations they are responsible that a particular item is there but not for what the item  item says and i do not  i  i think part  it may be significant if the algorithm is the same across  as justice thomas was suggesting across the different subject matters because then they do not have a focused algorithm with respect to terrorist activities or  or pilaf or something and then i think it might be harder for you to say that there is selection involved for which they could be held respons"," Well, but, I mean, the -- the -- the difference is that the Google, You -- YouTube, they're still not responsible for the content of the videos or -- or text that is transmitted. Your focus is on the actual selection and recommendations. They're responsible that a particular item is there but not for what the item -- item says. And I don't -- I -- I think part -- it may be significant if the algorithm is the same across -- as Justice Thomas was suggesting, across the different subject matters, because then they don't have a focused algorithm with respect to terrorist activities or -- or pilaf or something, and then I think it might be harder for you to say that there's selection involved for which they could be held responsible."
12,"MR. SCHNAPPER","the  the  the statute i think does not draw the distinction that way the  the claim here is about the encouragement of  of  of users to go look at particular content and that is the jasta claim that we will hear about tomorrow and the underlying substantive claim is encouraging people to go look at isis videos would be aiding and abetting isis more on that tomorrow but if that is an actionable claim then the conduct here would fit within it the  because certain individuals would be shown these thumbnails which would encourage them to go look at those video"," The -- the -- the statute, I think, doesn't draw the distinction that way. The -- the claim here is about the encouragement of -- of -- of users to go look at particular content. And that's the JASTA claim that we'll hear about tomorrow.

But, if that's an actionable claim, then the conduct here would fit within it, the -- because certain individuals would be shown these thumbnails, which would encourage them to go look at those videos."
13,"JUSTICE KAGAN","so i think you are right mister schnapper that the statute does not make that distinction this was a prealgorithm statute and you know everybody is trying their best to figure out how this statute applies this statute which was a prealgorithm statute applies in a postalgorithm world but i think what was lying underneath justice thomass question was a suggestion that algorithms are endemic to the internet that every time anybody looks at anything on the internet there is an algorithm involved whether it is a google search engine or whether it is this youtube site or  or  or a twitter account or countless other things that everything involves ways of organizing and prioritizing material and  and that would essentially mean that you know   i guess what i am asking is does  does  does your position send us down the road such that  really can not mean anything at al"," So I think you're right, Mr. Schnapper, that the statute doesn't make that distinction. This was a pre-algorithm statute. And, you know, everybody is trying their best to figure out how this statute applies, this statute which was a pre-algorithm statute applies in a post-algorithm world. But I think what was lying underneath Justice Thomas's question was a suggestion that algorithms are endemic to the Internet, that every time anybody looks at anything on the Internet, there is an algorithm involved, whether it's a Google search engine or whether it's this YouTube site or -- or -- or a Twitter account or countless other things, that everything involves ways of organizing and prioritizing material. And -- and that would essentially mean that, you know, 230 -- I guess what I'm asking is, does -- does -- does your position send us down the road such that 230 really can't mean anything at all?"
14,"MR. SCHNAPPER","i  i  i do not think so your honor the question  as you say algorithms are ubiquitous but the question is what does the defendant do with the algorithm if it uses the algorithm to direct  to encourage people to look at isis videos that is within the scope of jasta it is not different than if back in  a lot of clerks somewhere at prodigy did this manually and just had a bunch of file cards and they figured out who was interested in what the statute would have meant the same thing there that it does now it is automated it is at a larger scale but it does not change the nature of what they are doing with the algorithm so "," I -- I -- I don't think so, Your Honor. The question -- as you say, algorithms are ubiquitous, but the question is what does the defendant do with the algorithm. If it uses the algorithm to direct -- to encourage people to look at ISIS videos, that's within the scope of JASTA. It's not different than if back in 1996 a lot of clerks somewhere at Prodigy did this manually and just had a bunch of file cards and they figured out who was interested in what.

It did not and could not have written -- been written in such a way to protect everything else that might come along that was highly desirable. Congress didn't adopt a regulatory scheme. They protected a few things. It will inevitably happen, it has happened, that companies have devised practices which are maybe highly laudable, but they don't fit within the four walls of the statute.

276,"JUSTICE JACKSON","so i guess  i guess i am thoroughly confused but let me  let me try to  let me try to understand what your argument is i think that the confusion that i am feeling is arising from the possibility that we are talking about two different concepts and conflating them in a way i thought that section  and the questions that we were asking in this case today was about whether there was immunity and whether google could claim the defense of immunity and that that is actually different than the question of whether whatever it does gives rise to liability that is is there liability for aiding and abetting that is tomorrows question and to the extent that you keep coming back to this notion of creating content or whatnot i feel like we are conflating the two in a way that i would like to just see if i can clear up from my perspective your brief says that the immunity question section cs text is most naturally read to prohibit courts from holding a website liable for failing to block or remove thirdparty content and i read the arguments in your brief and i read what you said about stratton oakmont and the sort of background and so i thought your argument was that the  that you can only claim immunity google if the claim that is being made against you is about your failing to block or remove thirdparty content to the extent we are making a claim about recommendations or doing anything else any of the you know hypotheticals that people have brought up that is outside of the scope of the statute because really the statute is narrowly tailored in a way to protect internet platforms from claims about failing to block or remove right i mean that is what i thought was happening all right so if that is true then all the hypotheticals and the questions about are you aiding and abetting if google you know has a priority list or if there is recommendations maybe but that is not in the statute because we are just talking about immunity we are just talking about whether or not you have made a claim for failing to block or remove in this case today related to section  am i doing too much of a separation here in terms of how i am conceiving of it"," So I guess -- I guess I'm thoroughly confused, but let me -- let me try to -- let me try to understand what your argument is. I think that the confusion that I'm feeling is arising from the possibility that we're talking about two different concepts and conflating them in a way. I thought that Section 230 and the questions that we were asking in this case today was about whether there was immunity and whether Google could claim the defense of immunity and that that's actually different than the question of whether whatever it does gives rise to liability. That is, is there liability for aiding and abetting? That's tomorrow's question. And to the extent that you keep coming back to this notion of creating content or whatnot, I feel like we're conflating the two in a way that I'd like to just see if I can clear up from my perspective. Your brief says that the immunity question, Section 230(c)(1)'s text is most naturally read to prohibit courts from holding a website liable for failing to block or remove third-party content. And I read the arguments in your brief and I read what you said about Stratton Oakmont and the sort of background, and so I thought your argument was that the -- that you can only claim immunity, Google, if the claim that's being made against you is about your failing to block or remove third-party content. To the extent we are making a claim about recommendations or doing anything else, any of the, you know, hypotheticals that people have brought up, that's outside of the scope of the statute because, really, the statute is narrowly tailored in a way to protect Internet platforms from claims about failing to block or remove, right? I mean, that's what I thought was happening. All right. So, if that's true, then all the hypotheticals and the questions about are you aiding and abetting if Google, you know, has a priority list or if there's recommendations, maybe, but that's not in the statute because we're just talking about immunity. We're just talking about whether or not you've made a claim for failing to block or remove in this case today related to Section 230. Am I doing too much of a separation here in terms of how I'm conceiving of it?"
277,"MR. SCHNAPPER","well let me articulate what  what the contention is that we are advancing and i think it is not quite the way you described it the contention we are advancing is that a variety of things that we are loosely characterizing as recommendations fall outside of the statut"," Well, let me articulate what -- what the contention is that we are advancing, and I think it's not quite the way you described it.

282,"JUSTICE JACKSON","but i have got to tell you i do not see three elements in this i mean part of me  part of this is all the confusion i think that has developed over time about the meaning of the statement in the statute right i do not see three elements i see literally a sentence and the sentence in my view reads as though they are trying to actually direct courts to not impose publisher liability strict publisher liability against the backdrop of stat  of stratton oakmont so there is like some  somehow we have gotten to a world in which we have teased out three elements and we are trying to fit it all into that when i thought there was sort of a very simple sort of straightforward way to read the statute that you articulate in your brief which is this is really  this statute c is really just congress trying to not disincentivize these platforms for blocking and screening offensive conduct and so what they said is let us look at c let us have c let us have a system in which a system  a platform is not going to be punished strict liability for just having offensive conduct on their website and if they try  if they try to screen out we are not  we are going to say you will not be responsible for that either that is c but it really does not speak to whether you do a recommendation or whether you have an algorithm that does priorities or any of these other things that is how i thought that  that at least i was looking at the statute in light of its purposes and history and  and  and stratton oakmont and all of that in which case i think you would win unless your recommendations argument really is just the same thing as saying they are hosting isis videos on their websit"," But I've got to tell you I don't see three elements in this. I mean, part of me -- part of this is all the confusion, I think, that has developed over time about the meaning of the statement in the statute, right? I don't see three elements. I see literally a sentence, and the sentence in my view reads as though they're trying to actually direct courts to not impose publisher liability, strict publisher liability, against the backdrop of Stat -- of Stratton Oakmont. So there's like some -- somehow we've gotten to a world in which we've teased out three elements and we're trying to fit it all into that, when I thought there was sort of a very simple, sort of straightforward way to read the statute that you articulate in your brief, which is this is really -- this statute, (c)(1), is really just Congress trying to not disincentivize these platforms for blocking and screening offensive conduct. And so what they said is let's look at (c)(1). Let's have (c)(2). Let's have a system in which a system -- a platform is not going to be punished, strict liability for just having offensive conduct on their website, and, if they try -- if they try to screen out, we're not -- we're going to say you won't be responsible for that either. That's (c)(2). But it really doesn't speak to whether you do a recommendation or whether you have an algorithm that does priorities or any of these other things. That's how I thought that -- that at least I was looking at the statute in light of its purposes and history and -- and -- and Stratton Oakmont and all of that, in which case I think you would win, unless your recommendations argument really is just the same thing as saying they are hosting ISIS videos on their website."
283,"MR.

And then it refers to the defendant as an interactive computer service, and we have to parse out the meaning of, well, what does that mean?

286,"MR. STEWART","thank you mister chief justice and may it please the court i would like to begin by addressing the roger maris hypothetical because i  i think it illustrates our position and the limits on our position imagine in a particular state there was an unusually protective law that said no booksellers shall be held liable on any theory for the content of any book that it sells and then the scenario that the chief justice described occurred the person was asked where is the roger maris book and said it is over on that table with the other sports book  books now if the bookseller was sued for making that statement our position would be there is no way textually that the immunity statute would apply this is a statement about the book not the contents of the book now the statement the book is over there is so obviously innocuous that it might seem like pedantry to quibble about should the dismissal of the suit be based on immunity or for failure to state a claim but a court in thinking about the possibility of harder cases down the road should distinguish carefully between liability for the content itself liability for statements about the content and the other one other thing i would say is if the consequence of saying it is over there was that the bookseller lost its immunity for the content of the book that would be a big deal but our position on c is nothing like that our position is that the internet service provider can be sued for its own organizational choices but the fact that it makes organizational choices does not deprive it of the protection it receives for liability based on the thirdparty content i welcome the courts quest"," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to begin by addressing the Roger Maris hypothetical because I -- I think it illustrates our position and the limits on our position. Imagine in a particular state there was an unusually protective law that said no booksellers shall be held liable on any theory for the content of any book that it sells, and then the scenario that the Chief Justice described occurred, the person was asked where is the Roger Maris book and said it's over on that table with the other sports book -- books. Now, if the bookseller was sued for making that statement, our position would be there's no way textually that the immunity statute would apply. This is a statement about the book, not the contents of the book. Now the statement ""the book is over there"" is so obviously innocuous that it might seem like pedantry to quibble about should the dismissal of the suit be based on immunity or for failure to state a claim. But a court, in thinking about the possibility of harder cases down the road, should distinguish carefully between liability for the content itself, liability for statements about the content. And the other one other thing I would say is, if the consequence of saying ""it's over there"" was that the bookseller lost its immunity for the content of the book, that would be a big deal. But our position on 230(c)(1) is nothing like that. Our position is that the Internet service provider can be sued for its own organizational choices, but the fact that it makes organizational choices doesn't deprive it of the protection it receives for liability based on the third-party content. I welcome the Court's questions."

290,"MR. STEWART","i think that might matter with respect to whether there was substantive liability under the underlying cause of action it  it should not matter for purposes either of the hypothetical immunity i  statute i described which focuses exclusively on the contents of the books or for c now mister schnapper said in a colloquy earlier that he thought the allegations in his complaint are basically the same as those in the twitter complaint and the government is arguing in twitter that those allegations are not sufficient to state a claim under the antiterrorism act so our  our interest in c is not in allowing this particular suit to go forward it is in preserving the distinction between immunity  protection for the underlying content and protection for the platforms own choic"," I think that might matter with respect to whether there was substantive liability under the underlying cause of action.

Now Mr. Schnapper said in a colloquy earlier that he thought the allegations in his complaint are basically the same as those in the Twitter complaint. And the government is arguing in Twitter that those allegations are not sufficient to state a claim under the Antiterrorism Act. So our -- our interest in 230(c)(1) is not in allowing this particular suit to go forward. It is in preserving the distinction between immunity -- protection for the underlying content and protection for the platform's own choices."
291,"JUSTICE THOMAS","well i  i just think it is going to be difficult how would you respond to justice gorsuchs hypothetical about the artificial intelligence creating content organizational decis"," Well, I -- I just think it's going to be difficult. How would you respond to Justice Gorsuch's hypothetical about the artificial intelligence creating content organizational decisions?"
292,"MR. STEWART","i mean i think the organizational decisions could still be subjected to a suit whether you think of them as recommendations or simply as the platform  the operation of the platform it is still the platforms own choice and if you ask how did a particular video wind up in the queue of a particular individual it  it could be some  some sort of artificial intelligence that was making that choice but it would have to do with the  youtubes administration of its own platform it would not be a choice made by any thirdparty who had posted it because third parties who post on youtube do not direct their videos to particular recipients and  and i  i do want to emphasize this  this theory this rationale applies even in the most mundane circumstances for instance if you do a google search on the name for a famous person and you misspell the name slightly you still get lots of content about that person google knows that it is smarter than we are and it knows that  more about what we want than the literal terms of our search might suggest i went to the courts website and used the docket search function and typed in google and left off the  the final e and i got a message that said no items find  found in order to call up the docket for this case you have to spell google exactly right now the choice between those two modes of operating the platform it is extraordinarily unlikely almost inconceivable that it could ever give rise to legal liability but those are choices made by the platforms themselves they are not choices made by any third party they just do not implicate c and the choice  any conceivable lawsuit about the decision to use one mode of operation rather than another presumably would be dismissed on the merits but "," I mean, I think the organizational decisions could still be subjected to a suit. Whether you think of them as recommendations or simply as the platform -- the operation of the platform, it's still the platform's own choice. And if you ask how did a particular video wind up in the queue of a particular individual, it -- it could be some -- some sort of artificial intelligence that was making that choice, but it would have to do with the -- YouTube's administration of its own platform. It wouldn't be a choice made by any third-party who had posted it because third parties who post on YouTube don't direct their videos to particular recipients. And -- and I -- I do want to emphasize this -- this theory, this rationale applies even in the most mundane circumstances. For instance, if you do a Google search on the name for a famous person and you misspell the name slightly, you still get lots of content about that person. Google knows that it's smarter than we are and it knows that -- more about what we want than the literal terms of our search might suggest. I went to the Court's website and used the docket search function and typed in Google and left off the -- the final E and I got a message that said no items find -- found. In order to call up the docket for this case, you have to spell Google exactly right. Now the choice between those two modes of operating the platform, it's extraordinarily unlikely, almost inconceivable that it could ever give rise to legal liability, but those are choices made by the platforms themselves. They are not choices made by any third party. They just don't implicate 230(c)(1). And the choice -- any conceivable lawsuit about the decision to use one mode of operation rather than another, presumably, would be dismissed on the merits. But --"
293,"JUSTICE KAGAN","i  i think the problem mister stewart with minimizing what your position is is that in trying to separate the content from the choices that are being made whether it is by youtube or anyone else you can not present this content without making choices so in every case in which there is content there is also a choice about presentation and prioritization and the whole point of suits like this is that those choices about presentation and prioritization amplify certain message  messages and thus create more harm now i appreciate what you are saying is like well that does not mean that you are going to have liability in every case but  but  but still i mean you are creating a world of lawsuits really anytime you have content you also have these presentational and prioritization choices that can be subject to suit"," I -- I think the problem, Mr. Stewart, with minimizing what your position is is that in trying to separate the content from the choices that are being made, whether it's by YouTube or anyone else, you can't present this content without making choices. So, in every case in which there is content, there's also a choice about presentation and prioritization. And the whole point of suits like this is that those choices about presentation and prioritization amplify certain message -- messages and thus create more harm. Now I appreciate what you're saying is like, well, that doesn't mean that you're going to have liability in every case, but -- but -- but still, I mean, you are creating a world of lawsuits. Really anytime you have content, you also have these presentational and prioritization choices that can be subject to suit."
294,"MR. STEWART","let  let me say a couple of things about that the first thing i would say is you could make substantially the same argument about employment decisions that is in order for youtube to operate it has to hire employees but miss blatt acknowledges in the  the brief that employment decisions would not be shielded by c if there was an allegation of unlawful discrimination for instance so the fact that the platform has to make some sorts of organizational choices does not mean it is immune from suit in the rare instance where it might make a choice that violates some other provision of law the second thing is the concern we have in mind are things like imagine a hypothetical job matching service like indeed where job applicants can post their qualifications and potential employers can post their own listings and the website will match them up and suppose it came to light that the job  the job search mechanism was routing the highpaying more professional jobs disproportionately to the white applicants and the lowerpaying jobs to the black applicants even when the qualifications were the same at  at a general level you could describe that as choices about which content would go to which users but when we saw that kind of stark impropriety in the criteria that the platform was  was using i think we would say there has to be  assuming it violates applicable law c really should not be protecting that that is not  the complaint we have here is not to the content itself or the presence of the thirdparty job postings on the platform the complaint is about the use of illicit criteria to decide which users will get which content and our point is in the more innocuous cases or in the borderline cases where the criteria seem a little bit shaky but it is not clear whether they violate any applicable law that that choice ought to be made based on the law that the plaintiff invokes as the cause of action and the court ought to be determining does the use of those criteria violate that law and it "," Let -- let me say a couple of things about that. The first thing I would say is you could make substantially the same argument about employment decisions. That is, in order for YouTube to operate, it has to hire employees. But Ms. Blatt acknowledges in the -- the brief that employment decisions wouldn't be shielded by 230(c)(1) if there was an allegation of unlawful discrimination, for instance. So the fact that the platform has to make some sorts of organizational choices doesn't mean it's immune from suit in the rare instance where it might make a choice that violates some other provision of law. The second thing is the concern we have in mind are things like imagine a hypothetical job matching service like Indeed, where job applicants can post their qualifications and potential employers can post their own listings and the website will match them up. And suppose it came to light that the job -- the job search mechanism was routing the high-paying, more professional jobs disproportionately to the white applicants and the lower-paying jobs to the black applicants even when the qualifications were the same. At -- at a general level, you could describe that as choices about which content would go to which users. But, when we saw that kind of stark impropriety in the criteria that the platform was -- was using, I think we would say there has to be -- assuming it violates applicable law, 230(c)(1) really shouldn't be protecting that. That's not -- the complaint we have here is not to the content itself or the presence of the third-party job postings on the platform. The complaint is about the use of illicit criteria to decide which users will get which content. And our point is, in the more innocuous cases or in the borderline cases where the criteria seem a little bit shaky, but it's not clear whether they violate any applicable law, that that choice ought to be made based on the law that the plaintiff invokes as the cause of action. And the Court ought to be determining, does the use of those criteria violate that law? And it -- "
295,"JUSTICE ROBERTS","well i was just going to say your  the problem with your analogies is that they involve  i do not know how many employment decisions are made in the country every day but i know that whatever it is hundreds of millions billions of responses to inquiries on the internet are made every day and as justice kagan suggested under your view every one of those would be a possibility of a lawsuit if they thought there was something that the algorithm referred that was defamatory that you know whatever it is exposed them to harmful information and so that may be the analogy does not fit the particular  particular context"," Well, I was just going to say your -- the problem with your analogies is that they involve -- I don't know how many employment decisions are made in the country every day, but I know that whatever it is, hundreds of millions, billions of responses to inquiries on the Internet are made every day.

And so, if Google had posted a message that said we recommend that you watch this video, now the recommendation would be its own content.

And our understanding is that at least under the common law the answer to that would be no, that simply saying you should read this book that turns out to be defamatory would not be a basis for defamation liability. I think the same would basically be true of intentional infliction of emotional distress. That is, unless you could show that the platform was acting with the intent to cause emotional distress by circulating the video, there would be no liability. And the fact that the third-party poster may have met the elements of that offense wouldn't carry the day. With respect to antitrust, if you had a claim that a particular search engine had configured its results in such a way as to boost its own products or to diminish the search results for products of the competitor and if that were found to be a viable claim under the antitrust laws, there would be no reason to insulate the provider from liability for that.

That's at 34a of the -- of the petition. And your argument is that this neutral tools test isn't in the statute. What is in the statute is a distinction on the one hand between interactive computer service and access software providers and on the other hand content providers. And when we look at that, the access software provider is protected for picking, choosing, analyzing, or even digesting content. So 230 protects an access software provider, an interactive computer service provider, who does any of those things, whether using a neutral tool or not. They -- they can order, they can pick, they can choose, they can analyze, they can digest however they wish and they're protected, even those -- even though those editorial functions we might well think of as some form of content in our First Amendment jurisprudence, but, here, they're shielded by 230. And then your argument, I think, goes that none of that means that they're protected for content generated beyond those functions. And it doesn't matter whether that content is generated by neutral rules or not. That content is actionable whether the -- and one could think of content generated by neutral rules, for example, by artificial intelligence. And another problem also is that it begs the question what a neutral rule is. Is an algorithm always neutral? Don't many of them seek to profit-maximize or promote their own products? Some might even prefer one point of view over another. And because the Ninth Circuit applied the wrong test, this neutral tools test, rather than the content test, we should remand the case for reconsideration under the appropriate standard. Is that a fair summary of your position? And, if not, what am I missing?"
374,"MR. STEWART","i think the thing  the aspect of that we would disagree with is we do not think that the definition of access software provider means that an entity is immune from liability for performing all of those functions the statute makes clear that even if you perform those sorting arranging et cetera functions you still fall within the definition of interactive computer service and you are still entitled to the protection of c but the protection of c is protection from liability for the thirdparty content and so if you perform those sorting functions in a way that was otherwise unlawful you could be on the hook for that and that  that takes me back to the hypothetical about the job placement service that discriminates based on race the  the allegation of the job placement  of that job placement service is not that it created any of its own content the allegation would be that with respect to thirdparty content provided by the firms that were looking for employees it had used an impermissibly legal  a legally impermissible criterion to decide which content would be sent to which users and that would not be protected by c because imposing liability would not hold the platform  would not treat the platform as the publisher or speaker of the thirdparty cont"," I think the thing -- the aspect of that we would disagree with is we don't think that the definition of ""access software provider"" means that an entity is immune from liability for performing all of those functions. The statute makes clear that even if you perform those sorting, arranging, et cetera, functions, you still fall within the definition of ""interactive computer service,"" and you are still entitled to the protection of (c)(1). But the protection of (c)(1) is protection from liability for the third-party content. And so, if you perform those sorting functions in a way that was otherwise unlawful, you could be on the hook for that. And that -- that takes me back to the hypothetical about the job placement service that discriminates based on race. The -- the allegation of the job placement -- of that job placement service is not that it created any of its own content. The allegation would be that with respect to third-party content provided by the firms that were looking for employees, it had used an impermissibly legal -- a legally impermissible criterion to decide which content would be sent to which users. And that wouldn't be protected by (c)(1) because imposing liability wouldn't hold the platform -- wouldn't treat the platform as the publisher or speaker of the third-party content."

And the situation we're concerned with is what if a platform is able through its algorithms to identify users who are likely to be especially receptive to ISIS's message, and what if it systematically attempts to radicalize them by sending more and more and more and more extreme ISIS videos, is that the sort of behavior that implicates either the text or the purposes of Section 230(c)(1), and we would say that it doesn't."

(c)(1) forbids treating websites as ""the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another."" Publication means communicating information. So, when websites communicate third-party information and the plaintiff's harm flows from that information, (c)(1) bars the claim. The other side agrees Section 230 bars any claim that YouTube aided and abetted ISIS by broadcasting ISIS videos. So they instead focus on YouTube's organization of videos based on what's known about viewers, what they call targeted recommendations. They say that feature can be separated out because it implicitly conveys what viewers should watch or that they might like the content. But accepting that theory would let plaintiffs always plead around (c)(1). All publishing requires organization and inherently conveys that same implicit message. Plaintiffs should not be able to circumvent (c)(1) by pointing to features inherent in all publishing. (c)(1) reflects Congress's choice to shield websites for publishing other people's speech, even if they intentionally publish other people's harmful speech. Congress made that choice to stop lawsuits from stifling the Internet in its infancy. The result has been revolutionary. Innovators opened up new frontiers for the world to share infinite information, and websites necessarily pick, choose, and organize what third-party information users see first. Helping users find the proverbial needle in the haystack is an existential necessity on the Internet. Search engines thus tailor what users see based on what's known about users. So does Amazon, Tripadvisor, Wikipedia, Yelp!, Zillow, and countless video, music, news, job-finding, social media, and dating websites. Exposing websites to liability for implicitly recommending third-party content defies the text and threatens today's Internet. I welcome your questions."

So whenever you have something that's going beyond the implicit features of publishing and you have an express statement, you have a continuum, and this continuum is this: You have something that's the functional equivalent of an implicit message, basically, a topic heading or ""Up next,"" all the way to the other extreme of an endorsement of the content such that the website is adopting the content as its own. Now, when you have that situation, the claim is fairly treating the website for publishing its own speech, and you can separate that out from the harm that's just coming from the information provided by another. And the danger which your hypotheticals has raised with express speech is where on that continuum any express speech may go because, unlike Google and YouTube, which are the two world's largest sites, we don't have a lot of endorsements and that kind of stuff, but other websites and other users use a myriad of topic headings and emojis that have different meanings that I'm not prepared and you would have to know what they mean, like kinds of checkmarks and, I don't know, high fives and all kinds of things.

Football -- the same two users will enter the word ""football"" and get radically different results based on the user's past search history and their location and their language because most of the world thinks of football as soccer, not the way we do. And so, if you go down this road of did you target it, then you have to say how much? Was the topic hitting too much? Was it okay to have a violence channel? Was it okay to have a sex channel?

Isn't it true that that statute had a more narrow scope of immunity than is -- than courts have, you know, ultimately interpreted it to have and that what YouTube is arguing here today and that it really was just about making sure that your platform and other platforms weren't disincentivized to block and screen and remove offensive conduct -- content?

One is that you need an external law that has publication as an element, and then, second, which I think that your question may be going to, is it only directed to eliminating forms of strict liability across all causes of action? And so both -- both of those ways are highly problematic and also inaccurate given what was happening in 1996. In terms of just looking at this as is this just talking about defamation, it plainly can't be because the statute would be a dead letter upon inception because any defamation cause of action can be replead as negligence or intentional infliction of emotional distress.

(c)(2) is just a safe harbor and directs what happens when you take stuff down. It says nothing about what happens to the content that's left up. And so the more any website removes material, it perversely is showing that it has knowledge or should have known or could have known about the content that was left up. And so you have one of two things happen -- that -- that would happen and would have happened then and would happen now. The first is websites just won't take down content. And that just defeats the whole point, and you basically have the Internet of filth, violence, hate speech, and everything else that's not attractive. And the second thing which I think a lot of the briefs are worried about in terms of free speech is you have websites taking everything down and leaving up -- you know, basically, you take down anything that anyone might object to, and then you basically have -- and I'm speaking figuratively and not literally -- but you have the Truman Show versus a horror show. You have only anodyne, you know, cartoon-like stuff that's very happy talk, and otherwise you just have garbage on the Internet. And Congress would not have achieved its purpose of -- and, remember, it had in all those findings only three of which are addressing the harmful content.

455,"MS.

If I can just give you an example of a TV channel. When you broadcast an excessively violent TV channel, you're giving it a new audience that they wouldn't otherwise have. It's still inherent to publishing. And if you decide to run reruns of the most sexually explicit and violently explicit, you could say that's a bad thing, and it may be, but on your choice -- but it would be protected under 230. In terms of what was happening in 1996, I strongly disagree with the notion that algorithms weren't present based on targeted recommendations. The Center For Democracy and Technology has this wonderful history lesson of what was happening in '92 through '94 on how targeted recommendations developed. And you had something called news groups, which were for anyone using the Internet, that was sort of what people did. They signed up for a news group, and those news groups adopted the technology that is the technology that is alleged in this case. They looked at what the user was looking at. Say the user was looking at science news. And they thought, oh, that also user is looking at some other kind of news, maybe on psychology or something. And so they would make recommendations based on your user history and that of others. Amazon two months into 1997 introduced its famous feature, if you buy X, you might like Y based on that technology. So this technology was present starting in '92. And '92 through '96, the Internet was definitely different, but it was kind of a mess. You still had to organize it. So there were search engines. There was all kinds of features that were organizing content because even then it was massive. It's just now on, like, an exponentially greater scale."

Yet, if we take Justice Kagan's example, you're saying the protection extends to Internet platforms that are promoting offensive material. So it suggests to me that it is exactly the opposite of what Congress was trying to do in the statute."
461,"MS. BLATT","well i think promoting  i think a lot of things are offensive that other people might think are entertaining and so "," Well, I think promoting -- I think a lot of things are offensive that other people might think are entertaining, and so --"
462,"JUSTICE JACKSON","no it is not about  it is not about whether  let us take as a given we are talking about offensive material because that is all through the statute right you do not  you do not disagree that congress was focused on offensive material that that is sort of the basis of the whole statutory scheme so if we take as a given that we are talking about offensive material it looks to me from the text of the statute that congress is trying to immunize those platforms that are taking it down that are doing things to try to clean up the internet and in the hypothetical that was just presented we have a platform that is not only not taking it down in the way that the statute is focused on it is creating a separate algorithm that pushes to the front so that more people would see than otherwise the offensive material so how is that even conceptually consistent with what it looks as though this statute is about"," No, it's not about -- it's not about whether -- let's take as a given we're talking about offensive material because that's all through the statute, right? You don't -- you don't disagree that Congress was focused on offensive material, that that's sort of the basis of the whole statutory scheme. So, if we take as a given that we're talking about offensive material, it looks to me from the text of the statute that Congress is trying to immunize those platforms that are taking it down, that are doing things to try to clean up the Internet. And in the hypothetical that was just presented, we have a platform that is not only not taking it down in the way that the statute is focused on, it is creating a separate algorithm that pushes to the front so that more people would see than otherwise the offensive material. So how is that even conceptually consistent with what it looks as though this statute is about?"
463,"MS. BLATT","well so just a couple things and again i  we are on this defamatory material the website itself does something defamatory that is not  it is independent of the thirdparty content it is not protected but that same hypothetical could be said if it was on the front  the home page as opposed to you had to do a search engine first and i do not see anything in the statute that protects it in terms of what i think your deeper section is  deeper concern is the reading of the statute i do not think it is coterminous with c which is dealing with the type of offensive material which by the way does not mention defamation in terms of c we talked about how they work together we talked about how it could be easily overrode if it had just publication the one thing we did not talk about was the structure in section e e is a laundry list  a laundry list of a variety of exceptions under federal law to which c does not apply as well as c and those exceptions make very little sense if c is read the way you are reading it it would almost never apply to c and let us just take federal criminal laws it would make very little sense because those laws  almost none of them have strict liability as an element and vanishingly few would have publication or speaking as an element it is in there for no other reason other than that c would otherwise apply to the  the  the  the information provided by another and in terms of just the pure text when you keep saying its failure to take down i am hearing you say what congress wrote was treatment as a publisher that means dissemination that means publish"," Well, so just a couple things. And, again, I -- we're on this defamatory material. The website itself does something defamatory that's not -- it's independent of the third-party content. It's not protected. But that same hypothetical could be said if it was on the front -- the home page as opposed to you had to do a search engine first. And I don't see anything in the statute that protects it. In terms of what I think your deeper section is -- deeper concern is, the reading of the statute, I don't think it's coterminous with (c)(2), which is dealing with the type of offensive material, which, by the way, doesn't mention defamation. In terms of (c), we talked about how they work together. We talked about how it could be easily overrode if it had just publication. The one thing we didn't talk about was the structure in Section (e). (e) is a laundry list -- a laundry list of a variety of exceptions under federal law to which (c)(1) does not apply as well as (c)(2). And those exceptions make very little sense if (c)(1) is read the way you're reading it. It would almost never apply to (c)(2). And let's just take federal criminal laws. It would make very little sense because those laws -- almost none of them have strict liability as an element, and vanishingly few would have publication or speaking as an element. It's in there for no other reason other than that (c)(1) would otherwise apply to the -- the -- the -- the information provided by another. And in terms of just the pure text, when you keep saying its failure to take down, I'm hearing you say what Congress wrote was treatment as a publisher. That means dissemination. That means publishing."

And so the statute is like we want you to take these things down, and so here's what we're going to do. We're going to say that just because they're on your -- your -- your website, it doesn't mean you're going to be held automatically liable for it. And that's (c)(1). And to the extent you're in (c)(2), you're trying to take it down, but you don't get them all, we're not going to hold you liable for it.

467,"MS. BLATT","well i mean that  that is  what i understand the government and the petitioner to be saying is that disseminating  even  disseminating of isis videos is protected the only thing that is not protected is whether you can tease out something about the organization and call it a recommendation when there is no express speech recommending it it is just the placement of where in the order in which content appears and that same complaint could be made about search engines so i think under your view search engines would not be covered because they are taking user information targeting recommendations in the sense of they are saying we think you would be interested in the first content as opposed to the content on you know  sections i mean they have millions and millions of hits for any search result and if you think those are recommendations and the other side gives you no basis for distinguishing between search engines then the statute is just very different than i think the one that congress was talking about because again if you are going to look at findings and history and policy this is about diversity of viewpoints jumpstarting an industry having information flourishing on the internet and free speech"," Well, I mean, that -- that is -- what I understand the government and the Petitioner to be saying is that disseminating -- even 24/7 disseminating of ISIS videos is protected. The only thing that's not protected is whether you can tease out something about the organization and call it a recommendation when there is no express speech recommending it. It's just the placement of where in the order in which content appears. And that same complaint could be made about search engines. So I think, under your view, search engines would not be covered because they are taking user information, targeting recommendations in the sense of they're saying we think you would be interested in the first content as opposed to the content on, you know, 1,000,692 sections. I mean, they have millions and millions of hits for any search result. And if you think those are recommendations and the other side gives you no basis for distinguishing between search engines, then the statute is just very different than I think the one that Congress was talking about, because, again, if you're going to look at findings and history and policy, this is about diversity of viewpoints, jump-starting an industry, having information flourishing on the Internet, and free speech."

Let me give you an example that I think may help with the ad revenue sharing. So this was an allegation that YouTube was giving money to ISIS. Now this was in connection with third-party videos, third-party information. But the court said, no, that is not within Section 230 because that's independent of the information, that's giving money to ISIS. That kind of, whatever you think about its validity under the statute, you're not treating them as a publisher; you're treating them as a financer. And it's just -- and that's the test of the Fourth Circuit too. The Fourth Circuit is looking -- in that case, it was about -- you know, all kinds of things were happening with third-party information, and they were trying to tease out is it the credit report, did they contribute to the credit report, was it based on the website's failure to -- to notify the employee. And what the Fourth Circuit said is the exact same thing we said, and it's the exact same thing the plaintiff has said on four pages of its brief or four times in its brief, that you're looking for the harm. What is the harm caused? And this case is the perfect example. The plaintiffs suffered a terrible fate, and their argument is it's because people were radicalized by ISIS. And if you start with the concession that the dissemination of those ISIS videos are -- and a claim based on that is barred, the question is, is what additional comes from the way it was organized? The government just says, I don't know, let some state figure it out. That's not very helpful to Internets that have to work on a national level and are posting and sorting and organizing billions upon billions upon billions of piece of -- pieces of information."

I would say Henderson is like 96 percent correct. I got a little lost when they were going down the common law on publication, but the result was great. I just thought they got a little weird on the publication. But, yeah, no, their test is correct, and it's also the Ninth Circuit's test on the ISIS revenue. It's the exact same test we quote in our brief, and it's the exact same test Petitioner did. And what that harm test is doing, if I could just explain it because it sounds kind of shorthand, but if you take the -- which I'm not sure Justice Jackson agrees with, but if you take the underlying notion that this bars treatment as a publisher, and you're saying, well, can they get around it by the way they're pleading it, you're just looking to the harm, so you're saying you can't really say that's negligence or intentional infliction because the harm is coming from the publishing of the defamatory content. And so what I think all these cases where the courts are correctly saying 230 does not apply to the claim is they're isolating the harm and saying that's independent of the third-party information. It's either based on the website's own speech or it's website's own conduct that's independent of the harm flowing from the third-party information."

You know, is it -- is that news source, you know, from Russia? Probably not going to get on the top list. So, yeah, they're having to make choices because there could be over a billion hits from yours, and there are a -- a billion hours of videos watched each day on YouTube and 500 hours uploaded every minute, so it's a lot of content on YouTube. So some of it's based on channels, and some of it's based on searches. But they have to organize it somehow. But that is what's going on, I think, on your top searches, is they're -- in most search engines too, and you can look at the Microsoft brief, they're basing it on what -- time spent on those news sites, how many users are looking at them, how relevant it is, if it's -- if you're -- if you're typing in the Turkey earthquake, they might be elevating some stuff that's featuring that because it, you know, seems more relevant. If there's a recent election, they might feature that. So all these kinds of decisions are being made by websites every day."

That -- that has been given an extraordinarily expansive account here. So topic headings were characterized as inherent in publishing. You know, a topic heading could be how Bob steals things all the time. That's not -- shouldn't be protected. She mentioned ""Trending now"" as inherent in publishing, but that's like ""Featured today."" You could run -- you could have a site that didn't use the words ""Trending now."" Auto-play certainly isn't inherent in publication. And she mentioned home pages, and you have to have a home page, and that's fair, but you don't have to have on the home page selected things that you're drawing people's attention to. The home page that I have on my desktop for Google is a box and those charming little cartoons, and there isn't anything featured there. One could have a -- a website home page for YouTube that wasn't promoting particular things. That's just how they've chosen to do it. With regard to neutral tools, and this goes back to a point a number of you made about race, a neutral algorithm can end up creating very non-neutral rules. It's not hard to imagine that an algorithm might conclude that most people who -- who went to Spelman and Morehouse now live in Prince George's County and, therefore, in showing you videos, people who ask for videos about places to live near Washington, if they're black, they'll be shown Prince George's County; if they'll be -- if they're white, they'll be shown Montgomery County. The algorithms can create those kinds of rules. Whether -- characterizing that as neutral loses its force once the defendant knows it's happening. You know, to some extent, algorithms and computer functions can run amok, but you can't call it neutral once the defendant knows that its algorithm is doing that. And this runs a little bit into the issue that we'll be talking about tomorrow. Two short points and then one closing item. With regard to Rule -- Section (f)(4), I said this before, I just want to reiterate it, Section (f)(4) does not apply to systems or to information services. It only applies to software providers. The language of the statute is very specific. And with the question about the possible implications of the decision in -- in Taamneh, it -- it is fair -- it is normal practice in the district court when there's a motion to dismiss to permit the plaintiff to amend to deal with the relevant standard, and that's exactly what we ought to be afforded an opportunity to do.
